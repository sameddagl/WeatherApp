# Weather+

I developed a Weather App in order to learn URLSession, RESTful API's, delegates using MVC Design Pattern. I used [OpenWeatherMapAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) for all of my weather needs. I accessed current weather data  and 4 day / daily forecasts for any location.

When app starts, you can see city name, current temperature, weather condition image and description, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and weather forecast for 4 day according to your location. You can check the weather forecast of the city you want by clicking the search button at the top right corner by searching city name. And if you want to get the weather based on your location, you can press the location button on the top left corner.
